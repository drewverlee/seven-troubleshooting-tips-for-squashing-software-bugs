;; How do you fix bugs in your software? Is there a process, and if so, can it
;; be taught, or is it a path that has to be walked? These questions came to me
;; on the heels of another that I was asked recently on a job application:

;; > Describe a bug you had a primary role in fixing. How did you troubleshoot and resolve the issue?

;; Well, I thought, do you want the long or short answer? The short you say? Fine then,
;; the bug was a mistranslation, and to troubleshoot, I tested, and typed until I
;; *triumphed!*

;; Too short? Maybe, but I fear the full story would be too long.

;; Can we settle somewhere in between? Maybe find that middle ground between
;; a flattering short lie, and the confusing long truth.

;; And so we will go on a journey to collect my seven favorite troubleshooting tips!

;; But we warned! Journeys aren't straight lines. Oh no, they are winding rivers
;; that flow back into themselves. The landscape around us changes very little, and
;; in the end, it's our precipitations, and not the world, the bends.

;; So then, let me set you along the riverbank at a place that could be called
;; a beginning. From there, you will travel onward until the end, and your task will be to
;; keep your eyes open and see if you can catch the bug before it bites us.

;; Let me motivate the problem we are trying to solve. After all, if you don't
;; understand the pain, how can you hope to understand what there is to gain?
;; That sounds catchy. Let's write it down as our first troubleshooting tip:

       (merge
        {:padding       "10px"

                          :color            "white"})

;; Great, we hit our first tip, let's introduce the pain by understanding how we got there.

;; So then, imagine you're with your friends on a trip around Europe, and you stop and have lunch,
;; maybe at a peaceful out-of-the-way beer garden in Munchen.
;; At the end, a single bill. Not wanting to spoil the
;; moment with the technicalities, you offer graciously to pay for everyone.
;; Tomorrow, at dinner, someone else covers the bill. The trend of having
;; someone pay for the group continues.

;; However, at the end of the trip, everyone suddenly becomes concerned that they
;; didn't pay enough, but they are not sure who owes who what. Here is our painful
;; headache, we avoided the cost of settling up each night, only to delay it
;; until the end. As a result, we have a ledger of debts that need to be balanced,
;; they might look something like this:

;;  * Drew buys Kirsten a 10 ice cream cone.
;;  * Kirsten buys drew a 5 dollar soda.
;;  * Drew buys Katie a 5 dollar candy.

;; let's clean that up a bit by putting it in a table and giving our data well defined labels:

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :hide :result :hide}}
(def loans
  [{:loaner "drew" :loanee "kirsten" :loan 10}
   {:loaner "kirsten" :loanee "drew" :loan 5}
   {:loaner "drew" :loanee "kaie" :loan 5}])

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :hide}}
(clerk/table {:nextjournal.clerk/width :prose} loans)


;; We need to turn this into a set of loans to be repaid. Oh, and wouldn't it be
;; nice, because time is money, and sometimes there are transferring fees, to
;; guarantee it's the minimal number of loans needed? This would mean avoiding cycles like:
;; Drew paying Kirsten 10, and then Kirsten turns around and pays Drew 5 of that back.

;; At this point, you may be tempted to ask chatGPT or search Google for similar
;; problems. However, there is no strong reason to because we haven't hit
;; anything we can't resolve ourselves.

;; Is that another tip? You bet:

;; Instead of searching, let's see if visualizing the problem helps, and a useful
;; visualization, like a useful description, will try to remove ambiguity. In
;; this case we can represent a loan by an arrow/directed-edge where the direction indicates
;; which way the money travels. Here is how we would translate the collection of loans above to a graph:

;; And here is the graph after we consolidate the loans:

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :hide}}
(edges->graph!
  [["Drew" "Kirsten" 5]

;; Nice! We are almost ready to try and code a solution. As a first step, you might have noticed that we have two forms of expressing a loan, a hashmap:

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:result :hide}}
{:loaner "drew" "loanee" "kirsten" :loan 10}

;; and an edge expressed as a triplet:

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:result :hide}}
["drew" "kirsten" 10]

;; both of these are correct in their own way, and it's worth having both
;; because the hashmap carries the business terminology, while the edge is more
;; generic, concise, and will make it easier to pattern-match
;; our problem to others and re-use concepts from algorithms, graph theory,
;; mathematics etc...

;; I like this idea; let's add it to our troubleshooting tips:

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :hide}}

;; let's go ahead and follow our own advice:

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:result :hide}}

;; now a function to turn our edges into nodes.

         (fn [n->v [start-node end-node edge-weight]]
           (-> n->v
               (update start-node (fnil + 0) edge-weight)
               (update end-node (fnil - 0) edge-weight)))
         {})
       (into #{})))

;; My first thought was that at the function, at each step would need to take two
;; net-worths, the largest and the smallest, and create a loan between them, and add back any reminder.

;; In order to keep our layers clear, let's translate that to taking two nodes,
;; with the largest and smallest labels, and creating a directed edge between
;; them from the largest to the smallest with largest value as their edge weight.
;; If there is a remaining value, we add it back attached to the smaller node. Here is an implementation which does just that:

;; Now wrap that together into the function we were aiming for at the start,
;; notice that our mapping between the business domain and the graph layer is
;; very clear:

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:result :hide}}

(run-test test-loans->minimal-loans)

;; success!

;; ...
;; Or is it? Didn't I warn you this didn't have a happy ending? I assure you, despite our tests and careful planning
;; we failed. Do you see the issue? The problem is... I don't have the words to
;; describe it, so let me give you a glimpse of it. To do that, look at a set of net-worths/node-labels/integers:

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:result :hide}}
(def integers [-9 -8 -4 -2 -1 3 5 6 10])

;; Does anything jump out at you? I don't know why it would, but let me show you
;; in a picture why this set of integers is interesting. To do that, first, let's
;; turn it into a list of nodes. First, we make a helper to convert integers into
;; nodes by assigning the node-label a character as a node-id:

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:result :hide}}
(defn integers->nodes
  [integers]
  (into #{} (zipmap  (map char (range 97 123)) integers)))

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:result :hide :code :hide}}
(defn nodes->label->node-ids
  [nodes]
  (reduce
    (fn [label->node-ids [node-id node-label]]
      (update label->node-ids node-label conj node-id))
    {}
    nodes))

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:result :hide :code :hide}}
(def label->node-ids (-> integers integers->nodes nodes->label->node-ids))

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:result :hide :code :hide}}
(defn label->node-ids+labels->nodes
  [label->node-ids labels]
  (loop [label->node-ids label->node-ids
         labels labels
         nodes []]
    (if-not (seq labels)
      nodes
      (let [label (first labels)
            node-id (-> label label->node-ids first)
            node [node-id label]]
        (recur
          (update label->node-ids label rest)
          (rest labels)
          (conj nodes node))))))

;; Then another helper function to bring that together with the graphing function we have been using behind the scenes:

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:result :hide}}
(defn integers->min-edge-graph!
  [integers]
  (->> integers
       integers->nodes
       nodes->minimal-edges ;; <-- the function we put our faith in.
       edges->graph!))

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:result :hide :code :hide}}

  [nodes]
  (loop [nodes (vec nodes)
         edges []]
    (let [[start-node-id start-node-label] (peek nodes)

(integers->min-edge-graph-v2! integers)

;; This is the Bug! Our tips so far weren't enough to protect us from it, but that's ok because we're only halfway through them. And before we take the next step and tackle this pest, I want to take a moment and discuss why i think it's important to actually take a step back and think about how we framed this issue in the first place by calling it a bug.

;; In the software community a 'bug' commonly refers to any issue where
;; software is involved. Sounds vague? It is. Wikipedia's definition doesn't make things any more clear:

;; > A software bug is a bug in computer software.

;; Techopedia, the next search result, has this to say about bugs:

;; > A software bug is a problem causing a program to crash or produce invalid output.

;; That's only marginally better. Let's look outside tech to get a broader
;; perspective. To an entomologist, someone who studies bugs, a bug is anything
;; with a piercing mouth that sucks juices from plants or animals.
;; Interestingly, maybe a 1,000 years ago, 'bug' roughly meant bugbear. And now,
;; to most people it refers to those very little things that fly or crawl around.

;; The common theme here is that bugs are useless at best and likely irritating creatures that most would like to remove, which is why we call it 'debugging software'. However, I feel this outlook, when applied to troubleshooting, of assuming something has to be _removed_, is often misguided.

;; Often, instead, what's happened is that the author understands the program they have written, and how it will behave, but doesn't really understand what the objective is. For example, imagine a gardener who accidentally bought sunflowers seeds when they meant to buy tomato plant seeds. They dig, plant, water, wait, compost, all to end up with sunflowers. Would you suggest they start the process of getting what they want by seeing what they can remove from their sunflowers?

;;  There was nothing wrong with the plant they have, beyond that it's not the one they wanted. Gardeners call this undesirable plant a 'weed.' With that in mind, I want to make a suggestion to you, my reader, of not saying, "we have a bug," but asking:
;; Is this a bug or a weed? And that is my next troubleshooting tip:

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :hide}}
(tip! "5. Ask 'Weed or Bug?'" {:background-color "green" :color "white"})

;; While this distinction seems fuzzy in that both bugs and weeds are both
;; undesirable things, remember that a weeds defining characteristic isn't that there
;; is something wrong with it, but that it's just not the plant you wanted.

;; So a *software weed* indicates something needs to be _added_. As where a *software bug* suggests something needs to be _removed_. What matters is that the question starts to divide the problem. And breaking
;; the problem apart is the heart of effective troubleshooting.

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :hide}}
(ImageIO/read (.toURL (.toURI (clojure.java.io/file "resources/bug-yin-yang.png"))))

;; So, do we have a bug or a weed? Is there something our program is doing wrong?
;; Or is it that we don't understand what we really wanted in the first place?

;; Here is a hint, what didn't we actually test? Here are our tests for reference:

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:result :hide}}
["base cases"
 "remove cycles"
 "ok to transfer between unconnected nodes"
 "uneven positive and negative nodes"]

;; None of those claim to minimize transactions/loans/edges other than remove cycles, but are cycles
;; the only way you end up with extra transactions? Given the last graph we saw, it clearly is not.
;; Does removing a cycle help? Yes. Is it enough? Clearly not.

;; The question is how does our set of consolidated loans grow such at each step we ensure the
;; minimal number of transactions? First off, we need to strip away the
;; ambiguity of this question.

;; A transaction/loan/edge is produced anytime we add two net-worths/integers/node-labels and
;; get a non-zero result. So to avoid transactions, we want results that equal zero. So, given the choice, our algorithm should always pick 2 numbers that equal
;; zero. And given there is no option to do that, should it always remove one
;; node/net-worth/user from the set?

;; I think so, because if you don't the best you can do is eliminate two on your
;; next turn, which means it would have been just as good to eliminate 1 this turn and 1 the next.

;; So then, given no choice to remove-2 or remove-0, and we have to remove-1,
;; which one to remove? Put another way, which two numbers to pick! Well that
;; choice is recursive, you pick the two, that if not on this turn allow you to remove-2, then they will on the next, and the next, etc....


;; Implemented correctly what this would do is partition our original set, really a multiset
;; (duplicates allowed), into as many subsets as possible where each subset sums to 0, but themselves contain no subsets which sums to 0.

;; The 'easiest' way to find every possible subset that sums to zero, is to
;; take, every permutation of the original set, reduce over it, and collect
;; subsets that sum to zero by adding each integer encountered either to a
;; current-subset or, if that current-subset + new-integer equals zero, to the
;; collection of subsets that equal zero:

;;  * (1 -1 -2 2) 2 subsets because 1 + -1 = 2 and -2 + 2 = 0
;;  * (1 -2 -1 2) 1 subset because 1 + -2 = -1 and then -1 + -1 = -2 and finally -2 + 2 = 0

;; However the run time complexity of finding all permutations that is n! or (n)(n-1)..(n-n).

;; So is there a better way? Or maybe caching can help?

;; I wasn't able to see any better solutions, at first I thought if I could find
;; a way to select two numbers, such that my next selection would sum to 0, that would help,
;; but I quickly realized thats just kicking the can, as a 0 sum might not be possible in the next
;; solution either. This principle seems to apply to picking three numbers that sum to zero as well,
;; as our test case demonstrates. To illustrate that, I created a picture of that test case where the incorrect triplet is highlighted in red.

;; A bit disheartened because I knew a solution with permutations wouldn't scale very well,
;; Discouraged, but not dissuaded, I set about coding it up. First, just as we said, we will need something
;; to turn our set of integers into subsets that sum to zero:

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:result :hide}}
(defn integers->zero-sum-subsets
  [integers]
  (->> integers
       (reduce
         (fn [{:keys [zero-sum-subsets zero-sum-subset]} integer]
           (let [zero-sum-subset (conj zero-sum-subset integer)]
             (if (zero? (apply + zero-sum-subset))
               {:zero-sum-subsets (conj zero-sum-subsets zero-sum-subset) :zero-sum-subset []}
               {:zero-sum-subsets zero-sum-subsets :zero-sum-subset zero-sum-subset})))
         {})
       :zero-sum-subsets))


;; and use that to produce our zero-sum-subsets for one permutation

(map integers->zero-sum-subsets [[1 -1 -2 2] [1 2 -2 -1]])

;; and finally we just have to pick the permutation which produces the most zero-sum-subsets...

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:result :hide}}
(defn integers->max-zero-sum-subsets
  "Given a list of integers that sum to zero, partition them into the most
  subsets possible which also sum to 0, but which themselves contain no subsets
  that sum to zero."
  [integers]
  (->> integers
       permutations
       (pmap integers->zero-sum-subsets)
       (sort-by count)
       last))

;; thats how we got our example graph that had fewer edges from before:

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:result :hide}}
(defn integers->min-edge-graph-v2!
  [integers]
  (->> integers
       integers->max-zero-sum-subsets ;;<-- all the work is done here the rest is setup and tear down
       (mapcat integers->zero-sum-subsets)
       (reduce #(conj %1 (label->node-ids+labels->nodes label->node-ids %2)) #{})
       (mapcat nodes->edges)
       edges->graph!))

;; Is that it then? Are we doomed to a factorial time solution if we want to
;; guarantee the max-zero-sum? I'm not sure, honestly. I'm also not sure anything can be cached, aka, we can
;; use Dynamic programming to make this better. After all, what would we cache? Would we cache the sum-of-the-set to the set itself?
;; That would mean that any sets we cached would themselves contain sets/integers that were guaranteed to be 'the right ones'.
;; The problem doesn't seem reducible. But maybe I'm wrong. Time to look afield, and this brings us to another tip...

;; Feel free to look this over, but it doesn't seem to solve the problem. I

;; Let's move past AI and try good old Stack overflow. Here the [first,](

;; and [third](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/337125/finding-the-minimum-transaction) link also, as afar as i can tell, fail to suggest an algorithm which guarantees minimal transactions

;; I tried looking into what the competition was doing and found that SplitWise was using the
;; the [minimum cost flow algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum-cost_flow_problem), which i'm relative sure,
;; doesn't guarantee a minimal amount of transactions either. This [post](https://medium.com/@subhrajeetpandey2001/splitwise-a-small-approach-of-greedy-algorithm-4039a1e919a6#:~:text=The%20Debt%20Simplification%20Algorithm%20used,as%20few%20edges%20as%20possible.) seems to agree:

;; > Hereâs a simplified version of the (splitwise) algorithm:

;; > Calculate the net balance for each member in the group.
;; > While there are outstanding balances:
;; > Identify the member owed the most (vmax) and the member owing the most (vmin).
;; > Transfer the minimum of |vmax| and |vmin| from vmax to vmin.
;; > Update the net balances for both members. If the balance becomes 0, remove them from the set of vertices.
;; > 3. Repeat steps 2 until all balances are settled.

;; > This algorithm sacrifices the rule that âNo one owes a person that they didnât
;; >  owe beforeâ but efficiently settles balances. While its time complexity is
;; >  O(VÂ²) and space complexity is O(V), it may require more transactions than
;; >  necessary.


;; Two things to note there. The most important is that the author agrees with my
;; intuition that it may require more transactions than necessary, and if you read
;; the steps, it's what we tried on our first attempt.

;; And finally here is a
;; [post](https://medium.com/@mithunmk93/algorithm-behind-splitwises-debt-simplification-feature-8ac485e97688)
;; agreeing that the minimal transaction problem seems to be NP-complete.

;; > This indicates that the debt simplification problem is at least as hard as the Sum of Subsets Problem and hence it is NP-Complete

;; However, the author is making, I believe, a gross understatement. The subset
;; problem finds out if there exists a *single* subset of numbers that equal a given
;; number, discovering the maximum number of sets that the original set can break
;; into that equal, that number might be a degree or two more work.

;; So was I, in trying to understand why I couldn't find a better solution, trying to prove that P = NP all this time? It's hard for me to say beyond it felt maddening. Regardless, I didn't reach any outcome, so the Turing Award is still up for grabs.
;; Realistically, I believe understanding the mathematical nature of the problem, would require a good bit of investment to get correct. A good place to start would be MIT Professor Erik Demaine's lectures on Algorithms. I think its likely our goal of finding the minimal transactions is related the 2 or 3-partition problem which Erik is talking about here:

;; Does all this mean my idea is doomed? Not at all. It just means I have to be
